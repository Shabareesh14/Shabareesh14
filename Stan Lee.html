            <b>STAN LEE</b> (December 28, 1922 - November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics which later became<mark> Marvel Comics</mark>.
             He was Marvel's primary creative leader for two decades, expanding from a small publishing house division to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.<br><br>

             In collaboration with others at Marvel —particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko— he co-created iconic characters, including superhero <a href="#">spider-man</a>, <a href="#">the X-Men </a>, <a href="#">Iron Man</a>,<a href="#">Thor</a>,<a href="#">the Hulk</a>,<a href="#">Ant-Man</a>,<a href="#">the Wasp</a>,<a href="#">the Fantastic Four</a>,<a href="#">Black Panther</a>,<a href="#">Doctor Strange,the Scarlet Witch</a>, and <a href="#">Black Widow</a>. 
             These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics. In the 1970s, Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. 
             In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.<br><br>

            Following his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company. He frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel properties, on which he received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the person with the highest-grossing film total ever. 
            He continued independent creative ventures until his death, aged 95, in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.

            Lee was raised in a Jewish household. In a 2002 interview, he stated when asked if he believed in God,<u>"Well</u>,<u>let me put it this way.No, I'm not going to try to be clever. I really don't know</u>. 
            I just don't know."On another interview from 2011, when asked about his Romanian origins and his relationship with the country, he said that he had never visited it and that he did not know Romanian because his parents never taught it to him.
            Lee's father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the Great Depression.The family moved further uptown to Fort Washington Avenue,in Washington Heights, Manhattan. Lee had one younger brother named Larry Lieber.
            He said in 2006 that as a child he was influenced by books and movies, particularly those with Errol Flynn playing heroic roles.Reading The Scarlet Pimpernel, he called the title character<u>"the first superhero I had read about, the first character who could be called a superhero</u>.
            "By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in an apartment at 1720 University Avenue in The Bronx. Lee described it as<u>"a third-floor apartment facing out back".</u>Lee and his brother shared the bedroom, while their parents slept on a foldout couch.
            Lee attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx.In his youth, Lee enjoyed writing, and entertained dreams of writing the <mark>"Great American Novel"</mark> one day.
            He said that in his youth he worked such part-time jobs as writing obituaries for a news service and press releases for the National Tuberculosis Center;delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in Rockefeller Center; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on Broadway;and selling subscriptions to the New York Herald Tribune newspaper.
            At fifteen, Lee entered a high school essay competition sponsored by the New York Herald Tribune, called<mark>"The Biggest News of the Week Contest.</mark>
            "Lee claimed to have won the prize for three straight weeks, goading the newspaper to write him and ask him to let someone else win. The paper suggested he look into writing professionally, which Lee claimed<u>"probably changed my life</u>.
            He graduated from high school early, aged sixteen and a half,in 1939 and joined the WPA Federal Theatre Project.

            Roy Thomas, who succeeded Lee as editor-in-chief at Marvel, had visited Lee two days prior to his death to discuss the upcoming book The Stan Lee Story and stated "I think he was ready to go. 
            But he was still talking about doing more cameos. As long as he had the energy for it and didn't have to travel, Stan was always up to do some more cameos. He got a kick out of those more than anything else.
